# Basic ILC

Forked from Manu Schaan's repo to interface with the `cosmoblender` [code](https://github.com/abaleato/CosmoBLENDER/tree/master). This required translating to Python as well as a couple other minor changes

Computing linear weights to apply to microwave maps in order to generate cleaned component maps:
- CMB ILC
- tSZ ILC
- constrained ILC for tSZ with null response to CIB

Just clone and run: 
```
python driver_cmb_ilc.py
```
